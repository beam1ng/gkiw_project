# gkiw_project

GKiW project is a university OpenGL project made for Computer Graphics and Visualization laboratories.

This game lets players plane glide through procedurally generated collidable terrain, control players rotation avoiding
the gimball lock and many other interesting things, but the projects main focus was to implement custom shaders
written in glsl.

Here are some gameplay screenshots:
